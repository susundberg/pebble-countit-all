## Introduction 

Pebble application for counting and timing events.


This application provides easy way to count and time different events. You can configure up to three (one for each button) items to count and time and select a good icon to indicate the task. 

Currently app supports three type of actions for each button: duration, single and disabled. The duration mode allows you to measure actions with duration - like for example how long it takes to drink a beer or how long did the work travel take (with this route). The single mode allows you just mark events, like had a cigaret or changed baby diaper. The disabled mode is well, disabled, but it turns the screen light on, which can be handy if you measure something in night.

After you have measured you can open up a list of events on the watch (works offline without phone) and when the phone gets connected the watch syncronizes the events with the phone storage. On the watch app shows some statistics (avg interval, avg duration) on the events, but for futher analysis you can get to data copy-pasted or download to futher analysis.

The data export download is done via github page, due how pebble is made, but the app is open source and hosted on github, so you can track down no data gets gathered.
